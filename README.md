I have developed a Python app with a beautiful user interface using Tkinter. This app is capable of solving linear, quadratic, and cubic equations. It also provides teaching functionality, allowing users to learn how to solve these equations. Additionally, the app can sketch the graphs of these equations and includes exercises for each equation type. I’ve made it executable, so it’s not just source code. Furthermore, I’ve incorporated beginner-friendly quotes to enhance the user experience. Lastly, the app contains an integrated calculator, making it even more useful.
